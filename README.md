# CENG424 ASP Project: Course Timetabling Problem Visualization

## How to run

1. Generate the desired number of possible schedules using the following command:

```
clingo rules.lp <NUMBER_OF_SCHEDULE> --quiet=1 --opt-mode=optN > out.txt
```

For example, if you want to generate 500 possible schedules, you can use the following command:

```
clingo rules.lp 500 --quiet=1 --opt-mode=optN > out.txt
```

This command will direct the output to the `out.txt` file.

2.

- In order to visualize the output in a table form, open the Visualizer/table.html file in your browser.
- Upload the out.txt file using the "Choose File" button and click "Upload". The table will be displayed below.
- You can see the schedules one by one using the arrow buttons.

3. If you want to quickly see a sample schedule, you can also check the one in SampleSchedule.pdf .
